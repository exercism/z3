# Tests

To run the tests, first install the `z3-solver` package:

```
pip install z3-solver
```

Then you can run the tests by running the following command from the exercise's directory:

```
python <snake_case_exercise>_test.py
```

where `<snake_case_exercise>` is replaced with the exercise's name.
