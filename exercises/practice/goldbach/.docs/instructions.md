[Goldbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture) is
an old mathematical conjecture (a statement that has held true for demonstrated
cases and has never been proved false, but has never been proved true) that states
that any even number greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
Consider 4 (2 + 2), 6 (3 + 3), 8 (3 + 5), and 10 (5 + 5, 3 + 7). Write a function to
determine the two primes for a given number.
