# Instructions

Determine if a given set of three dominoes can be arranged in such a way that they form a
correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the
neighboring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halves of the
stones which don't have a neighbor (the first and last stone) match each other. Some test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution. Return `True` if a correct domino chain can be arranged and `False` otherwise. 

```text
For example, given: [(2,1),(2,3),(1,3)]
    True

For example, given: [(1,2),(4,1),(2,3)]
