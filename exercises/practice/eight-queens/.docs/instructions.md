The Eight Queens problem is a classic programming interview question. Fortunately, Z3 makes it easy to solve.
The problem is this: arrange 8 queens on a chess board such that no two queens can capture each other. In Chess,
queens can move any number of squares in any single direction (forward, back, left, right, diagonally). Write a
function that returns a list of python tuples for the positions of the 8 queens.
