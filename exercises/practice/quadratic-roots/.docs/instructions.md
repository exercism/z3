# Instructions

Implement a function that takes numbers `a, b, and c` that
describe a polynomial in the form ax^2 + bx + c. Calculate the real roots
of the polynomial, if possible, and return them as a tuple. Roots are the
numbers that cause the polynomial expression to evaluate to 0. Do not use the
quadratic formula to calculate r1 and r2. If the expression does not have
real roots, return `None`.
