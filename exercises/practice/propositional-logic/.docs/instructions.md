# Instructions

Implement a function using propositional logic to 
recreate the following properties:

1. A & B == (A' | B')' (DeMorgan's Law)
2. [A -> (A -> B)] -> (A -> B)
3. A & (B' -> A') -> B
 
Use the prove() function to confirm the accuracy of your theorems.  
Return the three theorems, in order, at the end of the function.
