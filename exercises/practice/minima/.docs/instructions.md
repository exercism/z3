Consider a polynomial function in the form f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Local
minima are defined as f(x) < f(x - delta) and f(x) < f(x + delta). Using this
definition, derive an expression for the local minimum and also solve for a
local minima with the given coefficients (a, b, c, d). The coefficients will
describe a function with at least one minima.
Return the x coordinate where the minima occurs.
