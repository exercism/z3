Consider a polynomial function in the form f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Local
minima are defined as f(x) < f(x - delta) and f(x) < f(x + delta). Using this
definition, derive an expression for a local minimum in Z3 and to solve for
a local minima on the function with the given coefficients (`a, b, c, d`).
Return the x coordinate where the minima occurs.
